BFIELDS directory:	Battle Fields
=================

A battlefield file contains descriptions of objects that are 
to be loaded into the 3d world.
The battlefield files can be represented in text or binary.
When objects are loaded in binary format they are initioaly created 
in info_xxx records. These can then be used directly or converted ioto 
worldinc.h Item/FormationItem/AirStruc objects.

This directory contains all the modules that make this happen.

There are 3 seperate programs that use the battlefield system:

Mission Editor (mainly meditor dir)
	Mission editor program first seen in FC. 
	Loads individual binary files into info_xxx records 
	and saves out text files for all ground objects.

MAKEBF:
	Compiles the whole text format script into binary files
	Quick mission scenarios are written by hand in text format

Main game:
	Loads binary files into info_xxx objects on the 2d map screen for the campaign
	Saves aircraft position info in binary before entering 3d
	Loads binary fiels into worldinc.h objects in 3d
