ENGLISH Directory: English-language specific files
-----------------

Each language has its own language specific directory:
ENGLISH
FRENCH
GERMAN
ITALIAN
SPANISH
RUSSIAN
etcetera...

The only really useful file in here is bob.rc. Eveything else is either an
input to bob.rc via the utility mergelst.exe or is old Mig Alley stuff.
For example, the help is now HTML and driven from an "uncle" directory: 
(C:BOB\HELP)
I don't recommend you run mergelst.exe unless you fully understand the
consequences!

If you edit the resource using the Dev Studio environment it will regenerate
RESOURCE.H and the icons in the language directory.
They need removing before you build (by the XxxCln project) so that the master
versions in the MFC directory are used.
