<h2>These are the notes associated with the currently highlighted item in the Daily Intelligence Summary dialogue.<a name="hidd_authorisation"></a>Target List</h2>
<p>
This Dialogue displays intelligence information about the recognized targets in North Korea. The targets have been allocated to the following categories:</p>
<p>
<b>Supply</b></p>
<p>
These are the key locations on the Communists supply routes. Typically the targets are either marshalling yards or warehouses.</p>
<p>
<b>Choke</b></p>
<p>
These are the bridges on the main supply routes</p>
<p>
<b>Traffic</b></p>
<p>
This list shows the key supply routes for the Communist forces.</p>
<p>
<b>Airfields</b></p>
<p>
This list shows the airfields available to the Communist forces.</p>
<p>
<b>Army</b></p>
<p>
This form is different from the other four. Instead of showing a list of targets, information about the frontline is shown. </p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
