This Dialogue consists of a list of the squadrons that are under your command. This Dialogue is launched from the <a href="bob0cxf.htm">Task Dialogue</a> and on entry, the squadron for the Current Group is highlighted.</p>
<p>
The number under the Available Column indicates the number of flights that are available for the Current Group. If there is more than one flight available, then the spin button at the top of the Dialogue can be used to change the allocation.</p>
<p>
It is possible to change the squadron allocated to the Current Group by clicking on the appropriate line in the list. However, it will not be possible to highlight a line for which there are no flights available.</p>
