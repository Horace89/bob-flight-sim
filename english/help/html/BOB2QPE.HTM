<p>
This Dialogue shows the weather forecast for North Korea for the next session.</p>
<p>
<b>Conditions/Visibility</b></p>
<p>
This information should be considered when making target choices. Your aircraft are not fitted with sophisticated radar equipment and so target acquisition is by eye. In bad conditions, choose targets that will be easily identified.</p>
<p>
<b>Temperature and Pressure</b></p>
<p>
During the summer, it may be difficult for some aircraft with heavy payloads to get into the air.</p>
<p>
<b>Contrail Layer</b></p>
<p>
The contrail layer should determine at which altitude you fly. The bobs have the advantage of being able to fly higher and so generally you should instruct flights to fly below the contrail layer. An attacking bob is easier to spot as it descends through the layer.</p>
<p>
<b>Wind Speed and Direction</b></p>
<p>
Wind speed and direction are quoted at two different altitudes. At certain times of the year it is more likely that the jet stream will offer a tail wind on egress. You should take advantage of this bonus.</p>
<p>
<b>Gusts</b></p>
<p>
If the weather is changeable, it is likely that you will suffer from gusts. This will make flying more stressful as you have to constantly adjust the controls.</p>
<p>
<b>Special Notes</b></p>
<p>
This gives the forecaster the opportunity of telling you about any special weather effects to note. For instance there may be mist in the valleys.</p>
