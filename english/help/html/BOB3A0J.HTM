<h2><a name="hidd_armyrequests"></a>Front Line Details</h2>
<p>
The Front Line report can be viewed from either the UN or Communist perspective by using the <i>UN Forces/Red Forces</i> tabs.</p>
<p>
The report is presented as two lists. The top list shows the forces deployed for the side chosen by the tab. One of the units will be highlighted. The bottom list shows any opposition forces, which are engaged with the highlighted force.</p>
<p>
For instance, when the UN Forces tab is selected the top list displays details about the UN Forces deployed in the designated area of the Front Line.  If one of the UN units is highlighted then the bottom list will show the Communist Forces that are engaged with it. </p>
<p>
It is possible to change the highlight by clicking on another entry in the top list.</p>
