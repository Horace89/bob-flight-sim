<h2><a name="hidd_wavetabs"></a>Routes</h2>
<p>
See <a href="bob2zcf.htm">Routes Overview</a> for a description about routes and waypoints in bob Alley.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Information about the Route for the Current Wave is organized onto two tabs:</dt>
<dd>
Main Route<p>
Target Zone</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For each tab it is possible to view the waypoint information in either Summary or Detail Form.</p>
<h4>Main Route: Summary Mode</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
In Summary Mode, a list of all the waypoints on the main route is displayed together with one attribute. Information about the following attributes are obtained by making a selection from the combo-box:</dt>
<dd>
Position<p>
Altitude</p>
<p>
ETA</p>
<p>
ETA (rel)</p>
<p>
Main Duty Fuel</p>
<p>
AAA Cover Fuel</p>
<p>
Air Cover Fuel</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The altitude can be displayed in either feet or meters and the fuel is displayed in either pounds or kilograms. The choice of units can be changed on the Units options on the View set of Preferences. The altitude shown is for the lead group. Escort groups that are of the same aircraft type as the lead group will also fly at this altitude. Other escort groups will fly at 1000ft below the contrail layer.</p>
<p>
The ETA is the estimated time of arrival at the waypoint. It is assumed that the Wave will travel at the cruise velocity of the slowest aircraft. The ETA (rel) is the ETA relative to the <a href="bob2zcf.htm">initial point</a>.</p>
<p>
The Fuel figures show the estimated fuel remaining at the waypoint. </p>
<p>
When Route information is being displayed in Summary Form, there are three buttons at the bottom of the Dialogue:</p>
<p>
<b>Insert</b></p>
<p>
Insert a waypoint after the currently highlighted waypoint. The highlight moves to the inserted waypoint. </p>
<p>
<b>Delete</b></p>
<p>
Delete the currently highlighted waypoint. You can only delete waypoints that you have inserted.</p>
<p>
<b>Center</b></p>
<p>
Scroll the map so that the highlighted waypoint is at the center.</p>
<h4>Main Route: Detail</h4>
<p>
In Detail Mode, all the attributes for the highlighted waypoint are displayed. In this mode it is possible to change the altitude and ETA for some waypoints:</p>
<p>
<b>Altitude</b></p>
<p>
All but the take-off and landing waypoints can be edited.</p>
<p>
<b>ETA</b></p>
<p>
Only the ETA of the Initial Point can be edited.</p>
<p>
For Detail Mode, there are two more buttons at the bottom of the Dialogue. These allow you to move to the next or previous waypoint in the route. In addition, clicking on the box containing the waypoint description will center the map onto the waypoint.</p>
<h4>Target Zone: Summary</h4>
<p>
The layout is similar to the one for<i> Main Route: Summary. </i></p>
<p>
On the Main Route, the Groups fly in formation. When they reach the Target Zone, they split off and follow their own set of waypoints. There is a tab for each Group so that each set is viewed separately. </p>
<p>
The list of Target Zone waypoints always starts with the Initial Point and ends with the Regroup waypoint.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Compared with the Main Route Dialogue, there is an extra combo-box for the Target Zone. The options are:</dt>
<dd>
Group<p>
Flight</p>
<p>
Element</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
You can use this combo-box to view and edit the waypoints at any of the above levels. It is possible then to give orders either at the Group, Flight or Element Level. </p>
<p>
For instance, if you want to send out a Group on Flak Suppression, you could just send the Group to patrol an area and let the pilots pick their own targets. However if you know where the targets are and you want to be sure that they are attacked then you can allocate up to two targets to each element.</p>
<p>
Instructions on setting extra targets are given in the <a href="bob0cxf.htm">Task Dialogue.</a></p>
<h4>Target Zone: Detail</h4>
<p>
The layout is identical to the one for the Main Route.</p>
