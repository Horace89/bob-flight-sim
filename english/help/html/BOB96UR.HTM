<p>
This Dialogue displays the list of pilots allocated to the <a href="bob135f.htm">Fighter Squadrons</a>. Clicking on the squadron tab at the top of the Dialogue will change the list of pilots displayed.</p>
<p>
You manage the pilots of the five squadrons based in Japan. Man Management of the Bomber Squadrons can be left to the Air Commander in Japan. Each squadron can launch up to four flights of four aircraft per day. There are six flights of pilots available and so the fifth and sixth flights don’t fly. They are resting.</p>
<p>
The pilot lists are displayed according to Flight and Element. Each flight consists of two elements of two aircraft. The flight and element leaders are on the left column and the wingmen are on the right.</p>
<p>
<b>Available Aircraft</b></p>
<p>
The number of available aircraft for the squadron is displayed at the bottom of the dialogue.</p>
<p>
At the start of a campaign, each squadron will have 19 aircraft available. That means you start with 3 spare aircraft for each squadron. Repair and replacement of aircraft takes time. It is possible then, when things are going badly, that you will not be able to send out the full complement of four flights. </p>
<p>
<b>Rotate Flights</b></p>
<p>
The <i>Rotate Flights</i> combo-box is used to determine how frequently the flights are automatically rotated. For instance, if<i> Every 3 days </i>is displayed, then after every three days each flight will be moved up into the place of the flight above: the sixth flight moves into the fifth’s slot, the fifth flight moves into the fourth’s slot etc. The first flight is moved into the sixth’s slot. Automatic rotation can be disabled by selecting <i>Never.</i></p>
<p>
It is possible for you to manually rotate flights by using the <i>dragging and dropping</i> method described below.</p>
<p>
<b>Bingo Fuel</b></p>
<p>
This is the minimum amount of fuel that should be available at the Regroup waypoint. During mission planning, you will be warned if this limit is exceeded. During missions, computer controlled aircraft will return home when this limit is reached.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>
Flights, elements and pilots can be moved around the squadron by using the <i>drag and drop </i>method. For instance to swap flight one with flight two:</dt>
<dd>
Click on the flight one icon. The pointer should change to a restricted sign.<p>
Drag the mouse pointer over the flight two icon. The pointer should change to a swap sign.</p>
<p>
Release the mouse button. The four pilots from flight one will swap places with the four pilots in flight two.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
When the Dialogue is first displayed flights five and six are not visible. You can use the scrollbar to bring them into view. However when moving pilots around the squadron it is more convenient to see all the flights at the same time. Clicking on the bottom edge of the Dialogue and then dragging downwards can increase the overall size of the Dialogue.</p>
<p>
Click on any <a href="bob12wj.htm">pilot</a> to get the personal details of the four pilots in the <i>clicked pilot’s flight</i>. This information is vital when deciding on promotions, demotions and allocating rest days.</p>
<p>
Some of the routine management can be done automatically by setting up the rotate flights combo-box. There are six flights, four of which are on active service each day. By setting the rotate flights to two days, you ensure that your pilots get two days rest out of every six.</p>
<p>
Clicking on the <a href="bob3m7o.htm">Losses</a> button will take you to the casualty lists for all your squadrons.</p>
