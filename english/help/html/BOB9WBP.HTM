<h2><a name="hidd_scale"></a>Scale Toolbar</h2>
<p>
The units shown on the scale are determined by the Units options on the View set of Preferences. If imperial units are selected then the scale is displayed in Nautical Miles. Kilometers are used if metric units are selected.</p>
<p>
The scale is fully dockable so that you can move it around the map. The scale can be forced to display horizontally or vertically. If the scale is currently horizontal, then click on the grab bar and drag it to the side of the screen. This will force the scale to flip to a vertical scale.</p>
