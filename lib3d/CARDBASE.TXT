##################################################################################
# This is the card database, containing fixes for cards...
# The format of this file is pretty simple (you'll have guessed that a '#' 
# is a comment line) Fixes come in a list (whitespace separated) after the 
# device identifier (in hex)
# Following fixes allowed - note case sensitivity (as I'm lazy...)
#		DO_DIAGS						  - write some diagnotsics to file 3D_Diags.txts
#		FRAME_TIME_BUFF	<integer>		  - store a buffer of frame times,
#											size is the argument.
#											will be output on exit to 3d into
#											3D_Timings.txt
#								
#		MIN_FRAME_TIME_MS <integer>		  - follow this by a number which is the 
#											minimum frame time in milliseconds
#											setting to 20 (which is max of 50 fps)
#											will often fix stuttering problems
#											The first line in this file uses
#											that as a generic fix for all cards
#
#       VERTEX_FOG                        - try this if there are fog problems 
#					    (usually things are blue in the 
#					    wrong places) or everything is blue.
# 	NO_TEXTURE_TARGET		  - try this if tiles (squares) of the 
#					    landscape are black or the wrong 
#					    colour.
#       SLOW_TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD             - as above, often needed in 
#					    conjunction with it.
#       SLOWEST_TEXTURE_DOWNLOAD          - as above, however only one of 
#                                           this fix and the previous one
#                                           can be active at once, if both 
#					    are in a line then the last to
#                                           appear will be used. 
#       LOCK_TARG_FMT_TO_BACK_BUFF        - as above, sometimes a better 
#                                           option as it can be quicker, however
#                                           can use up gfx card memory 
#                                           in 32 bit colour depth
#	NO_TEXTURE_BLEND		  - if the sea looks wrong or 
#					    the cloud layer looks wrong 
#                                           then this may be the option 
#					    for you (also effects the dither
#                                           antialiasing).
#       NO_DEVICE_VALIDATION              - this can fix the problems from 
#					    the above in a more satisfactory 
#                                           manner.  Also if the game 
#					    can't even get into the 3D it is a
#                                           good idea to try this one.
#       MAX_TEXTURE_WIDTH <integer>       - if textures seem to be cut 
#					    off or you can't get into the 3D                                            
#       MAX_TEXTURE_HEIGHT <integer>      - then using these two fixes 
#					    with values of 256 or 128
#	ALWAYS_USE_W			  - Always use a W buffer
#	ALWAYS_USE_Z			  - Always use a Z buffer
#                                         - if there is only a 16 bit or 
#					    smaller z buffer available we 
#					    will use a z buffer, otherwise 
#					    we will use a w buffer if the 
#					    card claims it can. Symptoms for 
#					    needing these fixes include the 
#					    3d not being displayed over
#                                           the splash screen, only the 2d 
#					    overlay.
#       FAKE_W_BUFFER                     - fakes a w buffer using z, 
#					    can prevent the above being used.  
#                                           fixed fog and specular for 
#					    the voodoo 5. 
#	NO_GUARDBAND_CLIP		  - don't do guardband clipping if 
#					    it is available
#	STIPPLE_ALPHA			  - fixes problems that may occur 
#					    with the luminous transparency 
#					    blending
#                                         - use if the view reticule in 
#					    the cockpit and the lens flares 
#					    look wrong
#       W_16BIT                           - use if textures don't mesh 
#					    tear along polygon in the 
#					    landscape and clouds
# the following should not be needed...
#       SET_TEX_FMT_NUMBER <integer> <texture type>     -       where texture 
#					    type is one of; 
#					    TF_LAND TF_LANDINIT

# Many cards will not need a line in this file to fix issues with them, 
# also some configurations will not need the fixes that are here, 
# however if after entering the 3D in the game there are obvious graphical
# problems then these may be avoidable using on or a combinations
# of the work around's available in this file.

# If your machine has a problem in the 3D try experimenting 
# with the functionality available within this file, this is the 
# general procedure to follow to try and find a fix;

# Step one - establish the device identifier (in hex) for your card.
# In order to establish the device identifier of your card, use a 
# default card fix, the easiest way is to uncomment the following line 
# (i.e. remove the '#' symbol), save this file and then enter the 3D
# again.  
#
#DEFAULT
#
# On the loading splash screen there should be a line displayed 
# reading something along the line of "using default fix, your 
# cards number is ????", where ???? is a hexadecimal number.
# write down the number given as you will need it later to build 
# your own line in the database below

# Step two - establish a fix or combination of fixes for your card.
# The first thing to do in order to try and find fixes for 
# your graphics card is to check the list and see if there is a 
# similar card already listed.  If there is this is normally a 
# good starting point of options to test.  To try out the different 
# options put the fix name (in capitals with spaces separating
# different options) after 'DEFAULT' on the line above.

# Step three - add your cards fixes to the database below
# Now you have all of the fixes that you need to play the game 
# you can add a specific line for your card to the database below.  
# The fist thing on the line is a description of your card, this must 
# contain no spaces but other than that there is no real restriction 
# on what you call it.  After this you should add some whitespace (a space 
# for example), then your cards identification number and more whitespace.  
# Finally copy the fixes from the default line you created onto the end 
# of the entry you have created for your card.  Don't forget to recomment 
# the default line.  Congratulations, you should have now created 
# a new database entry for your card.
