MEDITOR Directory:	The Mission Editor
==================

All the files in this directory are part of the mission editor. 
It also uses modules in other directories including fileman, bfields and H.

The mission editor is actually a C++ BUILDER project, 
compiled with C++ BUILDER version 1
If you have a later version of builder you are on your own!

This mission editor is a derivative of the version that shipped with FC Gold
in the sense that anything not pertinent to the development of MiG Alley or BoB
has been stripped down to a compilable state.

The major change is the handling of the much larger continuous worlds that both
these products use, and this is your first problem, as we use a 10GB database
to read the landscape from, which you don't have access to.

It would not be impossible to rewrite the interface in TT2 so that it decodes 
the landscape directly from the ingame compressed format, but this is left as an 
excersize for the reader, sorry.

The mission editor communicates with TT2 through the scratchpad and 
via shared memory blocks.

I never got the mouse wheel working so zooming is by right-clicking on 
the scroll-bar at present.

The other problem is that Borland still haven't fixed their enum operator overloading (AFAICT)
The following 3-line program won't compile, and so neither will our stuff without careful ordering.
The trick is to use unary operator + on any parameter that won't compile.
To allow this I have had to remove the 2 unary + ops I had!

enum	Oranges	{JAFFA,TANGERINE};
enum	Apples	{GRANNY,GOLDEN};
Oranges operator+(Oranges,Oranges);
int i=GRANNY+GOLDEN;		//compile error
int j=+GRANNY + +GOLDEN;	//fixed
