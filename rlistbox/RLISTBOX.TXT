RLISTBOX Directory: ActiveX string grid control
==================

A basic string grid with row and column headers and scrolling.
Columns can be made iconic.
Column widths can be set in the component editor, 
but there is only one Clear() function 
which deletes all the data and can delete column withs.
To handle this at a late date in the project, 
column widths will only be deleted if the grid contains no text.
Thus, in the code I insert an empty string in 0,0 during initialisation
to force the Clear() to not delete the columns.

There is other functionality in here associated with the 
ill-fated football game.
